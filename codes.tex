30-12-2020, Arjun, 30-12-2020\\ \textbf{Catalan's Conjecture}\\ There exists only one solution where $x=3, a=2, y=2, a=3$ to the equation \begin{align*} x^a = y^b = 1\end{align*} for $a,b > 1$ and $x,y > 0$.
31-12-2020, Arjun, 31-12-2020\\ \textbf{Angular Momentum of an Electron}\\ The angular momentum $(L)$ of an electron in the $n^{th}$ orbit is given by \begin{align*} L = \frac{nh}{2\pi} \end{align*} where $h$ is the Planck's constant. \begin{flushright} \textit{Niels Bohr} \end{flushright}
01-01-2021, Arjun, 01-01-2021\\ \textbf{Gibbs Free Energy}\\ In thermodynamics, the Gibbs Free Energy $(G)$ (named after Josiah Williard Gibbs) is a thermodynamic potential that calculates the maximum reversible work  performed by a thermo-dynamic system at a constant temperature $(T)$ and pressure $(P)$. It is given by \begin{align*} \Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S \end{align*} where $S$ represents its Entropy, i.e. the measure of randomness. S.I unit - Joules.
