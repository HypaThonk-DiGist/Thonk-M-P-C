# Thonk; Math, Physics & Chemistry
A project which contains one theorem/principle/conjecture/concept (preferably for each day).
It consists of the following subjects:-

1) Maths

2) Physics

3) Chemistry

It starts with a simple proof on New Year's Day (If you start reading on 1st of Jan) and cycles through 3 days for every subject.

We also colour code our boxes to represent the different subjects the things cover;

| Subject   | Colour |
| --------- | ------ |
| Math | Yellow |
| Physics | Blue | 
| Chemistry | Red |

## Contributing

### Github
This is the link to our Github Repository where we host most of the Static Files and we love Open-Source (Wait, who does not?), so we consider this a step towards accessible knowledge.

## An Update
We're taking Thonk to a greater level and our new project is focused on a deeper discussion into a specific topic and its scope in real life.
